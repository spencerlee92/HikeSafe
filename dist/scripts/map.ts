This compares to the approximately 25,000 who walk only the Tongariro Crossing section.The best time to go is during the summer months (from December to March). It is important to get information about the weather beforehand. Heavy rain can cause small rivers and therefore complicate the progress of the march significantly, some alpine parts are also quite exposed. Moreover, the beautiful scenery will be missed.

As a result, there are several tour operators that offer a variety of trip combinations covering all, or part of the route.Although the Great Walk route ends at Pipiriki, the river is navigable for a further 89 km and some canoeists continue to exit at the main bridge in Whanganui, which takes a further two days. Because the river is tidal closer to Whanganui, canoeists doing so need to ensure they leave Hipango Park on an outgoing tide.");

The track runs from Kohaihai, north of Karamea on the northern west coast of the South Island to the upper valley of the Aorere River, inland from Golden Bay.Before the area became a National Park mountain biking was permitted on the track. As a National Park use of the area comes under the National Parks Act 1980, which stipulates that vehicles are not allowed to be taken off formed roads. This prevents mountain bikers from using the track and debate has been on-going to allow at least some access. The New Zealand Conservation Authority decided to permit mountain bike access again from May 2011 for the winter months when tramping numbers are low. Mountain biking will be allowed each year from 1 May for groups not exceeding six riders.");

There is also foot access to the start via the Dore Pass Route (10.5 km one way) although this is an advanced track and not recommended for most walkers.[4] At the northern end of the track at Sandfly Point another boat is required to take trampers back to Milford Sound.

Hikers can arrange transport from Oban over the roads to and from the ends of the track, or can walk along the roads.The track generally follows the coastline for a large part of its length, passing small inlets, large bays and mudflats, and crosses steep hills covered in bush (dense forest) in its middle section. Large sections of the track have been gravelled. Without this, much of the track would degrade into mud, due to the peaty soil, and the rain that falls frequently throughout the year. In general, the track is well-maintained, and of easy to medium difficulty. Walking the track offers the unusual opportunity to see kiwi in the wild.
